# Smartschool-n8n

## This is a work in progress where I am making n8n nodes for smartschool, so you can automate your smartschool account completely (at least when this is finished)

Features:
  - generating login cookies for Smartschool (from ms login)
  - checking validity of a login cookie for smartschool
  - Fetching planner data
  - Fetching your inbox
  - Fetching a single mail by ID (you can find the id by fetching your inbox)
  - Fetching your Smartschool results

Ignore the random nasa picture nodes im too lazy to remove
